\section{Introduction}

As the cost of high-resolution sensors continues to fall alongside steady miniaturization and power efficiency improvements in modern computing hardware, the volume and velocity of observational data streams will continue to grow. In particular, smart cities, self-driving vehicles, smart grids, location-based services, and other types of autonomous systems will rely on real time data streams to make intelligent and timely decisions. These streams often contain readings for several dimensions or \emph{features} and include a spatial component, which may be relative (e.g., SLAM \cite{}) or have specific geospatial coordinates to describe \emph{where} the data was collected.
